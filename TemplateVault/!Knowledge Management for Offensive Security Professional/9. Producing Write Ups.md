# 9. Producing Write Ups

Now that we have gone through the use of plugins and all methodologies related to your vault, we move onto taking notes while hacking.

In this section I will go over my personal approach of hacking while taking notes and writing a report for hacking certifications.

For this tutorial I will hack the Blueprint machine from TryHackMe. This is a free room hosting a straightforward machine so we can focus on the note taking methodology. 

## 9.1 File Preparation

The first step is to prepare your session files.

**Obsidian File Prep**:

- Prepare a new folder in your vault with the name of the target machine. In this example I will be creating a new folder which would be located at *03 - Content* > *Write Ups* > *Blueprint*.

![[Pasted image 20240718162747.png]]

I will be attacking a standalone Windows machine in this case. For this reason I will need two files which I will generate using my templates.

Right-click on the Blueprint folder and select new note. 

![[Pasted image 20240718162820.png]]

The first note will be called "Blueprint External". This note is dedicated to external discovery/enumeration. This includes nmap port scans, general commands for the most used protocols and general web application enumeration commands. 

> Create a new note and select *Write Up Note* > *External Discovery Note*. You will be prompted for the IP for the target machine and the Note Generator will auto populate the new note with it. 

![[Pasted image 20240718165020.png]]

The second note will be called Blueprint Internal. This note is dedicated to discovery for privilege escalation and credential access once a foothold has been established. 

> Create a new note and select *Write Up Note* > *Windows Host Note*.

![[Pasted image 20240718165046.png]]

**Kali or Attacker VM File Prep**

On your attacker VM: Create a new directory in your attacker virtual machine (Kali in my case) with the name of the target machine on your desired location. (Add my bash alias)

In my case I have a directory dedicated to hacking related files located at my host machine. I gave my Kali machine access to it so these files are independent from my Kali VM.

![[Pasted image 20240711155820.png]]

If you are going to hack machines from different platforms, I suggest adding directories for each platform to make it more organized.

![[Pasted image 20240711155919.png]]

Then you want to create the machine's directory and a few subdirectories and files. Although this process can be achieved by executing a few commands, I will be adding a new script to my [.zshrc configuration file](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/zsh-configuration-files#3-zshrc) to automate this process. 

This is the pseudocode:

![[Pasted image 20240711161138.png]]

This is the final script:

```bash
function mkt(){
    if [ $# -eq 1 ]
    then
        mkdir $1 &&                                                         # main dir
        touch $1/commands.txt &&                                            # commands file
        mkdir $1/reports && mkdir $1/exploits && mkdir $1/tmp &&            # subdirs

        echo "Generated $1, $1/reports, $1/exploits and $1/tmp directories, $1/commands.txt file."
	else
        # working in pwd
        touch commands.txt &&                                               # commands file
        mkdir reports && mkdir exploits && mkdir tmp                        # subdirs
        
		echo "Generated reports, exploits and tmp directories, commands.txt file in $(pwd)."
    fi
}
```

![[Pasted image 20240711171706.png]]

After [sourcing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/source-command-in-linux-with-examples/) my new `.zshrc` file, I can use this function to create a directory for the "Blueprint" machine. 

![[Pasted image 20240711171736.png]]

- *Exploits*: Holds any scripts and public or custom exploits that are used to hack this machine.
- *Reports*: Holds any port scans, web application directory busting logs and other scan reports.
- *Tmp*: Holds temporary and backup files that I use while parsing through logs, creating user and password wordlists, etc. 
- *Commands.txt*: This file contains all commands used in order to hack the machine. It is most useful when attacking Active Directory sets or complex machines because sometimes your commands will be long or encoded and you will want to keep a log of what you have done thus far. This file is also helpful in the event of crashing the machine and starting all over again or if you have to go.

## 9.2 Hacking and Taking Notes  

First establish a VPN connection to the machine's network.

![[Pasted image 20240718215132.png]]

Now that we are connected to the machine's network, we are ready to start hacking. Open up the Blueprint External note and start your discovery process.

The workflow here is to copy and paste the autogenerated commands, then paste the output in each respective section.

### Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap 10.10.15.198 -A -p- -sC -sV -Pn -v --min-rate 1500 -oN 10.10.15.198_nmap
```

> In this case I am using a modified version of the nmap command using --min-rate and -v to perform this scan faster.

I can already see a few open ports, I like to perform enumeration on these ports while waiting for the nmap scan report.

![[Pasted image 20240718215718.png]]

After finishing the port scan, I pasted the output in the scan callout for future reference. Remember to include SMB information if available, some attacks can be performed when signing is disabled. 

![[Pasted image 20240718221349.png]]

> You can also copy and paste the output, instead of using screenshots to leverage syntax highlighting for easier reading. If you want to do this, create a code block using triple backticks and then use "less" as code language to activate highlighting.

![[Pasted image 20240718221155.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240718221056.png]]

I would then proceed to eliminate non-relevant sections from my external discovery note.

![[Pasted image 20240718215854.png]]

### RPC Discovery

I found valid usernames here. 

![[Pasted image 20240718222118.png]]

I then parsed the output of this command and piped it to a new users.txt file.

![[Pasted image 20240718222620.png]]

Finally I updated my commands.txt file and moved onto the next protocol. 

![[Pasted image 20240718222755.png]]

### SMB Enumeration 

I can read a shared called users according to "netexec". I then performed spidering on this share, moved the json report to my reports folder, reviewed it and moved on.

![[Pasted image 20240718230135.png]]

I did not find anything of interest after checking my json file. 

![[Pasted image 20240718230706.png]]

### SQL Enumeration 

I left a simple brute force command running and proceeded to the next protocol. 

![[Pasted image 20240718231008.png]]

### HTTP 80

Here I found a 404 page and started a directory bruteforce.

![[Pasted image 20240719014400.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240718234244.png]]

I kept moving to the SSL page on 404 while the brute forcing continues. 

### HTTP 445

I found a folder with a program name and version. 

![[Pasted image 20240718234304.png]]

> In this specific machine, since I already found a potential foothold, I tried exploiting it instead of enumerating everything. This is not always the case and *most of the time you will want to keep enumerating everything and pasting results* before proceeding (this is important in exams, because there are multiple rabbit holes on those). 

For the time being, I collapsed all sub sections under "Web Application - 445", and added a few notes.

![[Pasted image 20240718235057.png]]

### Foothold 

A quick google search revealed a script that could be used to exploit this machine. 

![[Pasted image 20240718234605.png]]

I proceeded to save the exploit in my exploits folder.

![[Pasted image 20240718234950.png]]

Then after troubleshooting and modifying the script to ignore self-signed certificates, I was able to exploit this vulnerability and get a privileged pseudoshell.

I took note of this whole process. 

![[Pasted image 20240719000936.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240719000943.png]]

Then I updated my commands.txt file with this information.

![[Pasted image 20240719001206.png]]

### Privilege Escalation 

I then used this pseudo shell to enumerate processes to see if antivirus was enabled. Then I enumerated the target architecture. Took note of these commands on my [[Blueprint External]] note.

![[Pasted image 20240719002628.png]]

I then opened a new tab and moved onto my HTTP server. I like using Apache for hosting my malware.

![[Pasted image 20240719002732.png]]

Generated a x86 meterpreter binary. 

![[Pasted image 20240719003018.png]]

Before transferring it, I used [invoke-webtransfer](https://github.com/Hacker-Hermanos/InvokeWebTransfer), a custom script that automatically generates transferring commands using files in `/var/www/html` (generates powershell and windows binaries commands) and piped its output to a new file called "transfer_commands.txt".

![[Pasted image 20240719003211.png]]

> This trick is very useful on exams and more complex machines because you just have to copy paste whatever tool you want to transfer when needed. 

Then I looked for `443.exe` on "transfer_commands.txt".

![[Pasted image 20240719003503.png]]

Copied and pasted this command on the pseudoshell. The logs show that the file was transferred correctly (always check the logs, sometimes your exploit might not display output).

![[Pasted image 20240719003641.png]]

Started an encoded handler (no need for encoding in this scenario but always a good practice).

![[Pasted image 20240719003929.png]]

Executed the exploit.

![[Pasted image 20240719003949.png]]

Received a callback. 

![[Pasted image 20240719004013.png]]

Then I documented the relevant steps on my [[Blueprint External]] note.

![[Pasted image 20240719004144.png]]

> If I had landed on a low privilege user, I would continue enumerating everything by following the [[Blueprint Internal]] note while documenting everything and taking screenshots.

### Internal Discovery 

#### Automated Discovery

Although I am already root, I will show you how I would go about enumerating this machine. 

I set the note to Source Mode to allow me to paste into the "Situational Awareness Notes" callout seamlessly.

![[Pasted image 20240719005829.png]]

I proceeded to transfer an automated recon tool, WinPEAS x86, ran it and start taking screenshots of relevant information to populate [[Blueprint Internal#Internal Discovery Notes|Internal Discovery Notes]].

Copied the `certutil` command from "transfer_commands.txt".

![[Pasted image 20240719010446.png]]

Transferred the tool to my target.

![[Pasted image 20240719010521.png]]

Then I would run it and take screenshots of important information and paste it on the internal discovery notes.

#### Manual Discovery Trick

If I was to perform this enumeration manually, I would open split the [[Blueprint Internal]] tab in two. 

![[Pasted image 20240719004902.png]]

After splitting the tab in two, I changed the upper note to source mode.

![[Pasted image 20240719004954.png]]

Then I changed the lower note to reading mode. 

![[Pasted image 20240719005037.png]]

This is the final result. 

![[Pasted image 20240719005052.png]]

This would allow me to copy the commands from the reading mode tab, paste them in my reverse shell / C2 and paste the screenshots on the Source mode tab. 

> The reason I would do this process is because working with the same Live Preview tab and copy pasting commands on a callout can be quite clunky.

After taking these screenshots and running the various commands I am left with the following: 

![[Pasted image 20240719011410.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240719011422.png]]
**(...)**
![[Pasted image 20240719011442.png]]

There is not much of interest here, other than the Administrator and Lab users (as Credential Access targets) and `inetpub` and `xampp` directories (these two webserver directories might contain files with credentials). 

### Credential Access

The next step would be to retrieve credentials and flags. 

I transferred mimikatz (x86) to the target. 

![[Pasted image 20240719012235.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240719012243.png]]

Executed mimikatz and extracted all credentials. 

![[Pasted image 20240719012414.png]]

Backgrounded the session and transferred BLUEPRINT.txt (the log file containing all credentials).

![[Pasted image 20240719012617.png]]

Now we have the NTLM hash for the Lab user and Administrator user.

![[Pasted image 20240719012735.png]]

Don't forget to go to the Administrator's desktop and retrieve `proof.txt`/`root.txt`.

![[Pasted image 20240719013351.png]]

> That last screenshot is essential for certifications such as OSCP and OSEP. 

After a few attempts I was able to retrieve Lab's cleartext password. 

![[Pasted image 20240719013557.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240719013609.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240719013626.png]]

### Clean Up

Now before moving on, I would clean up my Internal and External notes to make sure that non-relevant sections are removed.

These are the resulting outlines:

![[Pasted image 20240719014253.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240719014109.png]]

As you can see, everything is organized. Now we can proceed to produce a report for our exam using these notes.

## 9.3 Preparing a Report

- Create a report template.
- Go over creating the report, use report section templates.
- Export report to PDF.
